To load a specific data set:

    > data(scores.d1)
    > nrow(scores.d1)
    [1] 4527

Use update.scores() to update the data sets with the most recent data.  The
first update after installing the package must be a full update,
i.e. update.scores(full=TRUE).  Subsequent updates will only fetch the data
files that have changed since the last update.

Note that for the update feature to work the user must have write permission
in the package's directory, which is usually not the case when the package
is installed system-wide.
